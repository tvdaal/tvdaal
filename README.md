# Hi, Iâ€™m Tom ðŸ‘‹

On this account I list some projects that I have taken on just for fun and/or to improve on a certain technical skill. I love processing and analyzing data to extract valuable insights, for example with the use of machine learning techniques. My favorite programming language is Python.

## Background

After 2+ years, I recently wrapped up my work as a Data Scientist / Product Developer for [Sobolt](https://www.sobolt.com/), a tech start-up in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Although I wore many hats at this company, my main areas of focus were data analysis, software development, and project management.

Before going into data technology, I researched the internal structure of atomic nuclei at the [National Institute for Subatomic Physics](https://www.nikhef.nl/en/) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This led to various [publications](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1257922?ui-citation-summary=true) and a [PhD degree](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/mapping-the-internal-structure-of-hadrons-through-color-and-spin-) in Theoretical Physics.

I recently moved to San Diego, CA and am available for a new challenge as a Data Scientist or similar.
